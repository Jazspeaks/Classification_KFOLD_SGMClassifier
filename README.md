# Classification_KFOLD_SGMClassifier
This was a Classification project with a big dataset. In this project after feature engineering and cleaning the dataset I attempt various models to see which would perform well. Then I did some research and found out that the SGM classifier is the best model for this kind of dataset. Thereafter I used K_FOLD cross validation with 10 splits to train the model and then after validating the model I used hyperparameter tuning to increase its function. After that with scikit learn metrics library I measured the performance of the model with for evaluation techniques called precision, recall, accuracy and f1_score. F1_score was the best evaluation method for measuring the performance of this project and at the end I got 0.97 accuracy score.
